this is a small application enabling anyone to perform or to screen capture live-performed text display on background pictures, especially anyone may create lyric videos to ones favorite songs.

This application just requires and should work fine in any browser that supports ES6 and WebGL, and it is able to work completely serverless.

I use this in Firefox and sometimes Chrome, and as for now, Firefox performs best for this.

Right now, i bring some examples to work and try to show them inside this readme.

After that a short tutorial will be added, followed by a little documentation. 

Im am working on it right now. 
See ya later
