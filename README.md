This application enables anyone to perform or to screen capture live-performed text display on background pictures. Especially the ones knowing how to work with layered images, blending and seamless texturing will create decent looking performances - as long as they can handle adding some JSON-like style-definitions to their desired text.

The only requirement is a browser supporting ES6 and WebGL, as most of actual browsers do. Texter is able to work completely serverless. All required script-files, fonts and textures may be dropped into the browser window.

I use this in Firefox and sometimes Chrome, and as for now, Firefox performs best for this.


## Development progress

Right now, i'm getting some examples to work to show them inside this readme. Get a first glance of Texter here -> <a href="https://imatheria.github.io/Texter/texter.html" target="_blank">https://imatheria.github.io/Texter/texter.html</a>

Unfortunately, the GitHub-Pages routines collide with Texter's routines for fetching files, having it crash with a lot of errormessages from a bunch of \*.jsm files.
it seems i'll have to find a hosting solution for it. 

Texter just requires a static webserver with no other frameworks shooting in. So for now, you can download the repository and use a tool like hfs to access texter.html on localhost in your browser on your own machine.


## stuff to pop up here in near future

* Working examples
* A short tutorial, followed by a little documentation.
