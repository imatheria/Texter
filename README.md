This application enables anyone to perform or to screen capture live-performed text display on background pictures. Especially the ones who knowing to work with layers, blending and seamless texturing will create decent looking performances - as long as they can handle adding some JSON-like style-definitions to their desired text.

The only requirement is a browser supporting ES6 and WebGL, as most of actual browsers do. Texter is able to work completely serverless. All required script-files, fonts and textures may be dropped into the browser window.

I use this in Firefox and sometimes Chrome, and as for now, Firefox performs best for this.

## Development progress

Right now, i bring some examples to work and try to show them inside this readme.

After that a short tutorial will be added, followed by a little documentation. 

after all the work thats already done, this should be a matter of days now

See ya later
