This application enables anyone to perform or to screen capture live-performed text display on background pictures. Especially the ones knowing how to work with layered images, blending and seamless texturing will create decent looking performances - as long as they can handle adding some JSON-like style-definitions to their desired text.

The only requirement is a browser supporting ES6 and WebGL, as most of actual browsers do. Texter is able to work completely serverless. All required script-files, fonts and textures may be dropped into the browser window.

I use this in Firefox and sometimes Chrome, and as for now, Firefox performs best for this.


## Development progress

Right now, i bring some examples to work and try to show them inside this readme.
have a first look at it here -> <a href="https://imatheria.github.io/Texter/texter.html" target="_blank">https://imatheria.github.io/Texter/texter.html</a>

GitHub Pages seems to get in trouble with my file-drop-listener. Dropping images and font files actually let ... it crash


## stuff to pop up here in near future

A short tutorial will be added, followed by a little documentation.
